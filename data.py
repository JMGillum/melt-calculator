    This file stores the default silver and gold spot prices. These should be
    updated periodically, so they remain somewhat accurate. When the prices are
    provided via commandline, they are used instead of these, but these are not
    updated.

    Plans exist for creating a function to fetch these dynamically using some
    api. Someday...
